-10/9/19 (Day 1):

Our team decided to take the time in the Labs to come up with the skeleton
structure for our project as all team members have varying degrees of practice and
skill with the Game engine we are using.

We decided on using the unreal engine to create a first-person 3D platforming game,
we all thought of the mechanics that could be implamented based on what we know.
